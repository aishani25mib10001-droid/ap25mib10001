<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
Hospitals deal with tons of important information—patient records, doctor info, appointments, treatment histories, you name it. Trying to manage all of that by hand? It’s a headache. Mistakes slip in, data gets lost, and everything just slows down.<br>
So, the idea here is pretty simple: build a Hospital Management System that keeps track of all these medical and administrative records, but do it right. Using Python and SQLite, we can organize everything digitally, cut down on errors, and make the whole process way smoother.

<h2>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</h2>
1. Keep track of patient details like demographics, medical history, diagnoses, and treatments.
2. Save and update doctor profiles, including their specialties.
3. Handle appointment bookings, changes, and cancellations.
4. Use a well-organized SQLite database to store everything.
5. Let users interact through a straightforward menu in the terminal.
6. Make sure to validate inputs and handle errors smoothly.

<h2>TARGET USERS</h2>
1. Hospital administrators use it to keep track of patient and doctor records.
2. Receptionists handle appointments.
3. Doctors can quickly check their patient lists and schedules.

<br>
<h2>HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES</h2>
1. There is a patient module, a doctor module, and a whole setup for scheduling appointments. 
2. There is an authentication system baked in. 
3. Everything runs on SQLite, set up with an ER-based schema.
4. Plus, an audit trail logs what’s happening behind the scenes.
